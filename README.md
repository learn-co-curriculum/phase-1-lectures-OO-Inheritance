# Object-Orientation: Inheritance 

## Objectives

- [ ] Define a class which inherits from another class using the `extends` keyword
- [ ] Use the `super` keyword to extend class
- [ ] Understand how inheritance can be used to reuse code, and provide new ways to use existing code.

## Outline

```txt
5 min - Activation - Person/Teacher/Student behavior outline. What behavior is shared? Specific to the object?
15 min - Demonstration - Inheritance using extends
15 min - Check for understanding - extends with empty constuctor
5 min - Activation - How does actually extend child class functionality?
10 min - Demonstration - Inheritance using super
10 min - Check for understanding - using super to add further propities and functionality to a child class
---
60 min
```

## Person | Teacher | Student: Similarities and Differences

Class discussion on these objects, focusing on behavior and properties that can be shared across all, some, or none.

## Inheritance using extends

Demonstration

## Check for understanding

How does a class extend another class? Show a class with an empty constructor

## Discussion: How will we add more behavior and different properties to our child class?

## Using the Super keyword

Use super to add addition properties to an object of child class - inside constructor
Use super to add addition functionality to an other instace method

## Check for understanding

Class driven development. Create a new parent child relationship?
